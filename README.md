# tecs

A LuaJIT game engine built directly on SDL3, SDL_GPU, and Box2D 3, replacing
the rendering layer Tecs previously ran on. Entities are the interface:
anything that renders or updates per frame is an entity in a Tecs world.

SDL owns the loop. An entry file returns an application and a C host drives it
from `SDL_AppInit`, `SDL_AppEvent`, `SDL_AppIterate`, and `SDL_AppQuit`:

```lua
return tecs.application({
    load = function(app) end,
    update = function(app, dt) end,
    event = function(app, event)
        if event.kind == "appWillEnterBackground" then end
    end,
    quit = function(app) end,
})
```

That shape is not a preference. iOS never hands control back for a blocking
loop to sit in, so a host that cannot be entered by callback cannot run there
at all. The same shape works on desktop, so there is one lifecycle rather than
one per platform. The callbacks are C reaching Lua through the Lua C API, not
FFI callbacks, which are a trace barrier and unsafe from a thread the VM did
not create.

Everything below Lua is reached through the FFI. There are no Lua C extensions:
the only native code is a host that owns `main`, and even that is never called
from Lua.

## Status

Working today:

- Generated FFI bindings for SDL3, Box2D 3, shaderc, and SPIRV-Cross, verified
  against the C ABI
- A window, a Metal/Vulkan/D3D12 GPU device, and a swapchain render loop
- GLSL compiled at runtime to SPIR-V and translated to MSL, with resource
  bindings reflected and remapped for the backend
- Immutable graphics pipelines, storage buffers, uniform buffers, and offscreen
  render targets with pixel readback
- Compute pipelines with reflected workgroup size, and GPU-driven drawing: a
  compute pass writes the draw arguments, one indirect draw consumes them
- A declarative pass graph, and a deferred pipeline built on it
- An ECS binding: Transform2D, Tint, Sprite, PointLight, and Renderable
  components,
  with a sync that walks archetype columns straight into mapped GPU staging
- Physics in the world: a RigidBody component holding a Box2D handle, stepped
  in FixedUpdate and synced back to Transform2D
- Input in three tiers behind a layer stack, latched for fixed steps
- Worker threads with serialized channels, and asset loading that decodes on
  one and uploads on the main thread
- Box2D 3 simulation with value-typed body handles
- Frame pacing from the swapchain, with no sleep heuristic

- Shaders packaged as artifacts, so a release links no compiler
- A platform contract with five seams, and an SDL implementation of all five
- Tweening and sequencing, ported with their suites

Not built yet: shadows, post-processing, audio, text, UI, tiled maps, and the
MCP surface.

This project is merging into `tecs`; the two are becoming one. Design notes
live in `../tecs-plans`, kept outside this repository so plans and code have
separate histories.

## Workers and assets

Workers are the only sanctioned way to run work off the main thread. Raw
thread creation stays unexposed: a LuaJIT FFI callback invoked from a thread
the VM did not create is unsafe, and a thread entry written in Lua is exactly
that mistake. The native side starts a thread with a fresh `lua_State` and
moves opaque byte blocks between queues; it never learns what a message
contains, because serialization stays in Lua.

That boundary is not a style choice. LuaJIT has no shared mutable heap across
threads, so a worker cannot see the spawning state's objects at all. What
crosses is numbers, strings, booleans, and tables of those.

Sends are checked before encoding rather than left to fail inside the encoder.
That is partly for the message, which names the offending path instead of
saying a function turned up somewhere. It is mostly because the failing path
proved unsafe: an encode error raised while worker threads are running
intermittently terminated the process instead of surfacing, at roughly one run
in ten under a coroutine-based test runner and never standalone. The mechanism
is below this code and unresolved. Not calling the encoder with something it
will reject keeps that path unreached.

Asset loading rides on that. Decoding a PNG is milliseconds of pure CPU work
with no GPU involvement, so it happens on a worker and the main thread only
uploads. The worker returns the *address* of a decoded surface rather than its
pixels: surfaces live in process memory, so the pointer is valid in either
state, and passing it avoids copying an image through a serialized message
only to copy it again into staging. Ownership transfers with the address.

## Events

One typed stream, derived from SDL, shared by desktop, mobile, replay, and
tests. Game code never sees an `SDL_Event`: the union is a poor thing to
program against, and its pointer is only valid inside the callback that
produced it, so the host copies each event into a queue and the conversion
happens once.

`Event` is one wide record discriminated by `kind` rather than a union of
per-kind records. Teal can express the union but not a union that pools, and an
event stream that allocates per event is not one this engine can use. Records
handed to a handler are reused, so `events.copy` exists for anything that
retains one.

Unrecognised SDL events arrive as `unknown` carrying their numeric type instead
of being dropped, so upgrading SDL surfaces new input rather than silently
losing it.

A touch finger's identity is 64 bits and does not fit a double, so it is
carried as an opaque string. Reporting it as a number would round, and two
distinct fingers could collapse into one.

The engine acts on lifecycle and input events and then hands every event to the
game anyway. An engine that consumed events would leave a game unable to tell
an event it never received from one it mishandled.

## Input

Live state answers "is it held". Frame events answer "did it change this
frame". Latched events answer that for fixed-step systems, which is not the
same question: a key pressed and released between two fixed steps is invisible
to frame events, and losing it produces input loss that varies with frame
timing and so cannot be reproduced on demand. Latched sets accumulate across
every frame since the last fixed step and clear when it ends. The run loop
brackets the fixed phases itself, because that bracketing is the entire
mechanism.

Queries are answered relative to a layer. A blocking layer hides input from
everything beneath it, so a menu suppresses gameplay without gameplay code
knowing a menu exists. Code that names no layer reads the base layer, which is
the safe default: it goes quiet when anything is pushed over it.

The state is fed one `SDL_Event` at a time and holds no globals, so a recorded
session replays by feeding the same events back through `events.source`.

## The Tecs binding

Tecs itself is unchanged and consumed as a dependency. What lives here is
tecs's own surface on top of it: components, a renderer that syncs from a
world, and a physics plugin.

`Renderer` is the bridge, and the only module that knows about both
archetypes and GPU buffers. Everything below it is renderer; above it is
Tecs.

Images live in one array texture, so the texture is a per-instance layer index
and the whole scene is one draw. That is also what frees the instance layout:
with nothing to sort by, each archetype keeps a contiguous run, and a run whose
components did not change is not rewritten.

That gating is the point. Walking every entity every frame is the cost that
decides whether a large world is affordable, and most frames change very
little. A still scene resyncs nothing at any size:

```
 4,000,000 entities, static      frame
 ──────────────────────────────  ────────
 world the size of the view      80.1 ms
 world 4x the view               21.1 ms
 world 8x the view               11.7 ms
 world 16x the view               7.0 ms
```

Four million is the ECS's ceiling: an entity id packs its slot into 22 bits.

What is drawn is decided on the GPU. A compute pass tests each instance against
the view, compacts the survivors into an index list, and writes the draw
arguments, so the draw touches only what is visible and the CPU never learns
how many that was. The first row above is the case the cull cannot help with,
where the whole world is on screen; there it costs about a sixth of a frame
for nothing. Every other row is what a world larger than its window looks
like.

Populate with `world:batchSpawn`, not a spawn per entity. A single spawn
resolves an archetype, allocates an id, and moves a row every time it is
called; in bulk that is the difference between fifteen milliseconds and nine
seconds. The callback writes columns in place, so no component values are
constructed at all. Note that `batchSpawn` skips FFI defaults, so every field
has to be written in the callback.

Layer zero is a white pixel, so an entity with no `Sprite` samples it and
textured and untextured geometry share one shader and one pipeline. An image
smaller than a cell does not reach the cell's edge, so `registerImage` returns
a ready `Sprite` rather than a bare index: a caller guessing the UV range
would sample the undefined remainder.

A `Sprite` names its image; which layer that name occupies is the renderer's
answer to it. Layers are handed out as images register, so a layer number
means whatever loaded in that position, and one written into a snapshot is a
different image the moment the assets load in a different order. So a snapshot
stores the name, `registerImage` keeps a registry from name to layer, and
registering a name twice answers with the layer it already holds instead of
consuming another. The layer is cached in the `Sprite` when it is built, or on
the first frame that writes a restored one, because extraction reads it for
every row and a lookup per row is a lookup too many. A name nothing is
registered under fails rather than drawing whichever image holds that layer.

Its sync reads columns with `get`, never `getMut`. Taking a mutable column to
read would mark those components dirty on every archetype every frame, which
defeats every dirty-gated consumer downstream. That distinction is the single
easiest thing to get wrong here and the hardest to notice.

Syncing runs in `RenderFirst` inside the world's update; rendering happens
afterwards against a frame. The two stay separable because the sync needs no
command buffer and the render needs no world, which also means the swapchain
is held for as little of the frame as possible.

## Buffer writes

SDL_GPU has no mappable device buffer. Data reaches one by being written into
a mapped transfer buffer and copied across in a copy pass, and the transfer
buffer must be unmapped before that copy is encoded. That staged copy is
unavoidable.

What is avoidable is a second one. `Buffer:map` returns the driver's own
address, so a producer walking archetype columns copies straight into it
rather than filling a staging array that then has to be copied again.
`mapAs` gives the same memory as a typed array, for writing struct fields in
place.

Writes are tracked as ranges rather than replacing the whole buffer, because
most frames change very little of what is resident. Adjacent writes merge;
past a fixed number of distinct spans the dirty region collapses to one,
trading bandwidth for bounded bookkeeping but never dropping a range.

The destination is never cycled. Cycling discards a buffer's contents, which
would erase every range a frame did not rewrite, and that failure looks
exactly like a bug in whatever reads the buffer later rather than like an
upload problem. `flush` takes the caller's command buffer so the copy is
ordered against the frame that consumes it instead of racing a separate
submission.

## The pass graph

Passes name the targets they read and write. The graph owns those targets,
resizes them with the frame, begins and ends each pass, and binds each pass's
inputs as fragment samplers, so a pass body only draws.

Execution follows declaration order rather than a topological sort. The order
of a deferred pipeline is a design decision, not something worth rediscovering
every frame, and a graph that silently reorders is harder to reason about than
one that refuses to run. Declared inputs are validated against what earlier
passes produce, so a missing dependency is an error when the graph is built
instead of a black screen later.

The graph knows nothing about entities, archetypes, or dirtiness. A pass that
should be skipped says so through `enabled`, which is where an ECS-side dirty
gate plugs in without the graph learning what dirty means.

One depth attachment is shared by whichever passes ask for it, sized and resized
with the frame like every other target. Its format is discovered rather than
assumed: Metal has no `D24_UNORM` and a Vulkan driver may have that one and not
`D32_FLOAT`, so the device is asked which of the three it supports as a depth
target and the best answer is taken. Depth state is declared per pass, because a
pass that must not have an attachment is as ordinary as a pass that must, and a
pipeline bakes its target info, so the graph answers both cases through
`depthOf` rather than leaving the call site to assume one.

`Deferred` assembles the standard pipeline on it: geometry fills a G-buffer,
lighting resolves it against a storage buffer of lights, and composite puts the
result on screen. Geometry is a callback because what to draw is the caller's
problem. Deferred is what makes light count independent of object count:
geometry rasterises once regardless of how many lights touch it, and lighting
runs once per pixel regardless of how many objects overlap it.

Geometry is the pass that owns depth, testing and writing, so wherever two
instances overlap the nearer one is what the G-buffer keeps. An instance's depth
is the fourth float of its transform vector, and the comparison is
`lessOrEqual` rather than `less`: equal depths let the later fragment through,
so draw order still decides ties and depth only decides between instances that
differ. Lighting and composite have no attachment. Each covers every pixel
exactly once and has nothing to be occluded by.

## GPU-driven by default

`make run` animates 512 instances and issues exactly one dispatch and one
indirect draw per frame. Per-instance data lives in a storage buffer that a
compute pass updates, and the instance count is written by that same pass into
an `SDL_GPUIndirectDrawCommand`, so the CPU never learns it.

That is the whole reason for the deferred-only decision. There are no vertex
buffers anywhere: shaders index storage buffers by vertex and instance ID.

## The shader pipeline

GLSL goes to SPIR-V through shaderc, then to MSL through SPIRV-Cross. Runtime
compilation is a requirement rather than a convenience: material variants are
assembled from preprocessor defines at load time, so an offline-only bake would
not serve them.

SDL abstracts the whole API across Metal, Vulkan, and D3D12 identically, but
it deliberately does not abstract shaders: `SDL_CreateGPUShader` takes
precompiled bytecode in a backend-specific format and never compiles or
translates. That is the one platform-specific seam, and this is the code that
sits on it. Only MSL and SPIR-V are produced today, so Windows resolves to the
Vulkan backend; D3D12 would need DXC for DXIL.

A release compiles nothing. On iOS there is no writable executable memory to
hand a compiler, on a console there is no compiler to link, and everywhere else
it is tens of megabytes baked into a build that already knows every shader it
will ever use. So every shader the engine can ask for is registered by name in
`tecs.gpu.shaders`, and `make shaders` walks that registry and writes a pack:
code, entry point, reflected counts, workgroup size, and a hash of the source it
came from. Because the builder calls the same compiler a development build
calls, the packaged reflection cannot drift from what would have happened at run
time.

Nothing about that path degrades quietly. `shadercompiler.plan` decides where a
shader comes from and takes "can this build compile" as an argument, since a
running process cannot unlink its own compiler to test the rule that matters
most. A shader missing from the pack, or present but built from source that has
since changed, is a recompile where one is possible and an error where it is
not. The device claims the pack's format for the same reason: claiming a format
the build cannot supply selects a backend that fails at shader creation rather
than at startup.

Content is never resolved against the working directory. That happens to work
when a build is launched from a project root and is meaningless the moment
anything else launches it, and on a device there is no useful working directory
at all. The build states where content sits relative to the executable, the C
host resolves both its entry chunk and the asset root against that, and an
installed tree runs from an unrelated directory with nothing in the environment.

## Porting to a platform SDL does not cover

SDL covers every platform this engine can be built for openly. It does not
cover the ones whose SDKs are licensed, and those cannot live in this repository
even for someone who holds a licence, because their headers may not be
redistributed. So the engine names its platform seams instead. There are five,
and a port supplies these and touches nothing above them:

```
 Seam        What a port supplies                       Where it plugs in
 ──────────  ─────────────────────────────────────────  ───────────────────────
 lifecycle   A host that calls _init, _receive,         its own entry point
             _iterate, _shutdown
 events      Typed events, produced directly           adapter.events
 static FFI  Function pointers taken at build time      native/registry.c
 storage     Content and writable roots                 adapter.basePath/prefPath
 shaders     A pack in the platform's own format        adapter.shaderFormat
```

Each is a seam rather than a fork because everything above it is already
indifferent to the answer. The application is an object a host drives rather
than a function that runs until done, which is why iOS and a console SDK can
both call the same four methods. Events are one typed stream discriminated by
`kind`, so a platform with no `SDL_Event` produces those values directly. A
target that forbids `dlopen` reaches its libraries through a table of pointers
taken at build time, and nothing calls `ffi.load` when one is present. The pack
layout does not change for a platform with private bytecode; only the declared
format does.

`tecs.platform.adapter` holds the SDL implementation of all five, which
doubles as the worked example. `spec/adapter_spec.lua` installs a platform that
is not SDL and drives real work through it, because a seam nobody has ever
substituted is a guess about what a port would need rather than a contract.
That spec is not a console port and cannot be one; it is the evidence that a
port has five things to supply.

The fiddly part is bindings. SDL_GPU consumes compiled shaders and is told
separately how many resources of each class they bind, and it fixes the
descriptor sets shaders must be authored against. Those sets differ by stage:

```
 Stage     Textures and storage buffers   Uniform buffers
 ────────  ─────────────────────────────  ───────────────
 vertex    set 0                          set 1
 fragment  set 2                          set 3
 compute   set 0 read-only, 1 read-write  set 2
```

Metal has no descriptor sets, so those bindings are flattened into `[[buffer]]`
and `[[texture]]` indices in the order SDL_GPU's Metal backend expects. Both
the counts and the remapping come from reflecting the SPIR-V, because a wrong
count is not a compile error. It is a silent binding mismatch.

That is also why `spec/render_spec.lua` renders offscreen and asserts on real
pixels. A draw that produces nothing still runs at full frame rate, so "it did
not error" is not evidence that it drew.

## Locked decisions

These shape the seam and are effectively impossible to retrofit, so they were
settled before anything was written.

**Deferred only, no immediate mode.** SDL_GPU bakes blend, depth, and cull into
immutable pipeline objects and has no global state to set. An immediate-mode API
would have to be built in order to then be worked around, so there isn't one.
Every draw goes through a render pass on an explicit frame.

**The command buffer is a value, never a global.** `Device:beginFrame` returns a
`Frame` that carries its own command buffer, and anything recording work takes
that frame explicitly. SDL_GPU permits a command buffer per thread; a module
global would make threaded recording impossible to add later without touching
every drawing site.

**Nondeterminism is injectable.** `platform.clock` and `platform.events` both
read through a provider that defaults to the real source. A replay driver
substitutes recorded dt and recorded input without either subsystem knowing.
Events are delivered as a reused `SDL_Event`, so recording is a 128 byte copy
and replay is the same copy back, with no second representation to keep in sync.

**Resource handles are owned by the platform, not by Lua's collector.** Windows
and devices are released by an explicit `destroy`. Tying GPU-adjacent lifetimes
to finalizers makes hot reload either leak or double-free depending on
collection order.

**The ECS and the engine are one project.** They were separate while this
replaced the previous rendering layer and the ECS stayed renderer-agnostic.
The renderer's whole job
is reading archetype columns, and the ECS's storage layout decides whether that
is fast, so the boundary stopped paying for itself. Storage that a GPU can read
directly is the reason to merge, and it is not expressible with the two apart.
Headless worlds keep working: GPU-backed storage is opt-in per component.

**Workers will be the only threading path.** LuaJIT FFI callbacks invoked from
threads the VM did not create are unsafe, so raw thread creation will not be
exposed even though the symbols are bound.

## Reaching native code

A library is reached through a registry the host installed if there is one, and
through `ffi.load` otherwise.

`ffi.load` needs a shared object and a working `dlopen`. iOS has neither: every
library is linked into the executable and loading one by name at run time is
not permitted. A target like that can still call C, but the addresses have to
be taken at build time.

So the build emits, for each library, a struct of typed function pointers and
one C file that fills it by taking the address of each function. The host
installs those tables into every Lua state, including every worker state, before
any Lua runs. A worker resolving its own libraries would reintroduce the
dependency on dynamic loading in the place it is hardest to notice, since a
worker that fails to start looks like a worker that had nothing to do.

```
 sdl3        1231 functions
 box2d        421
 spvc         169
 sdl3image    102
 shaderc       45
 worker        10
```

Signatures come from the generated cdef rather than being parsed again, so the
pointer table cannot disagree with the bindings. Both are generated with the
same preprocessor defines the C is compiled with: a header that declares
different things under `NDEBUG` would otherwise produce a binding for a
function the build does not have.

The tables hold functions only. Enum constants are compile-time values that
need no library loaded, so they resolve through the FFI's own namespace and the
engine finds both through one handle. Resolved names are memoised, so a name
costs a lookup once rather than on every call.

Taking the address of a shader compiler's functions means linking it, which is
the coupling `TECS_RUNTIME_SHADERS=OFF` removes: a release generates no table
for shaderc or SPIRV-Cross and links neither.

## Bindings are generated, never hand-written

`scripts/gencdef.py` runs the system preprocessor over the installed headers,
keeps the declarations that came from the library, and rewrites them into the
subset of C that LuaJIT's parser accepts. Integer `#define` constants are
recovered separately by compiling a program that prints them, because the
preprocessor expands them away before a cdef could see them, and because many
of them (`SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE`) hide behind helper macros that pattern
matching misses.

A hand-maintained cdef does not fail to link when it drifts. It reinterprets
memory and surfaces later as corruption far from the cause. `make abi-check`
compares LuaJIT's view of every generated record against the C compiler's:
size, alignment, and the offset of every field. It currently verifies 192
records across the four libraries.

Header-only `static inline` helpers have no symbol to bind and are
reimplemented in Lua. That is usually faster anyway, since the JIT can inline
Lua where it cannot inline across an FFI call. `World.getAngle` converting a
`b2Rot` cosine/sine pair is the current example.

## Layout

```
host/main.c                 process entry: a Lua state and argv, nothing else
scripts/gencdef.py          header -> cdef + constants generator
scripts/abicheck.py         cdef vs C compiler layout verification
src/tecs/ffi/             library loading and generated binding wrappers
src/tecs/platform/        window, clock, events
src/tecs/gpu/             device, frame, passes, shaders, pipelines, buffers
src/tecs/components.tl    components the engine renders and simulates
src/tecs/Renderer.tl      the world-to-GPU bridge
src/tecs/physics/         Box2D binding and its world plugin
spec/                       busted suite
```

## Build

CMake is canonical. Make is a wrapper that forwards to it, so there is one
description of how the engine is assembled rather than one per platform to keep
in step.

```
make presets        list the platform matrix
make build          build the selected preset
make run            run the demo
make test           run the spec suite
make check          type-check Teal sources
make abi-check      verify generated cdefs against the C ABI
make package        install a tree into out/package
make check-package  verify a package carries its own dependencies
make deps           install development dependencies (Homebrew)
```

`PRESET=` selects the target; it defaults to `macos-arm64-dev`. Presets come in
two kinds. A development preset resolves dependencies from the system, which is
convenient and not shippable: it links the build machine's libraries by
absolute path. A packaged preset builds pinned revisions from source, so a
release is reproducible and carries no path from the machine that made it.

`make check-package` is the gate on that distinction. It inspects the installed
binaries for search paths and absolute references that leave the package, and
for a shader compiler a release is not meant to ship. On a development install
it reports what it found and passes, because those references are expected
there; on a packaged one it fails. A package that resolved a library from the
build machine works there and nowhere else, and the failure only appears once
someone else unpacks it.

`TECS_FRAMES=N make run` exits after N frames, so an automated run can drive
a real window to completion.

## Requirements

CMake 3.24+, LuaJIT, SDL3 (3.4+, for SDL_GPU), SDL3_image, Box2D 3.x, shaderc,
SPIRV-Cross, and Teal (`tl`). `make deps` installs them on macOS.

Dependencies are found through pkg-config rather than a package manager's
paths, which is what lets the same build description cross-compile. Box2D ships
no pkg-config file and is located directly.

SPIRV-Cross is distributed as static archives only, and the FFI needs a shared
object, so the build links one. Whole-archive linking is deliberate there: the C
API's symbols are not referenced from the stub, so the linker would otherwise
discard every one of them.
